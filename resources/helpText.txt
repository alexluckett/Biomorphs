About the Application

Welcome to the Biomorph Mutation Application. This project is a prototype software application 
which allows you to produce evolutionary art based on Richard Dawkins's Biomorphs and extending
this in a new and creative way. As a beginner user, you will be restricted as to how you can 
manipulate the biomorph. For complete control, head over to the advanced user

How to use(Main Menu):
This is will generate menu with different options to choose from.

1.Beginner
Opens the basic graphical interface

2.Advanced
opens the advanced graphical interface

3.Help
Pull up the user manual on how to use the application

4.Quit
Exit the application

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use (Beginner mode):
Generates a basic biomorph and evolves the biomorph using the branch selector 

1. Generate Biomorph
This is will generate artwork iteratively by the computer through an artificial evolutionary 
process. The software will have random representations of different artworks and the process will
be repeated if this button is pressed

2. Branch selector 
This will allow to evolve the biomorph by selecting the branch and changing the angles and size
using the mouse pad 

3. Add to Hall of Fame
This will add the generated biomorph to the hall of fame

3.1 Hall of Fame panels
Display the saved biomorphs

3.2 Remove
removes the biomorph from the Hall of Fame

4. Save as Project
Save your project by clicking this button. 

5. Save as Image
Saves the biomorph as a image by clicking this button. 

6. Load Project
Load an existing project by clicking here.

7. Help
Pull up the user manual on how to use the application

8. Main Menu
There are two user type modes. This is the beginner user. Click this button to try the advanced
user

9. Undo
returns the previous evolved biomorph

10. Exit
Exit the application

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use (Advanced Mode):
Generates a Advanced biomorph with the abilities of changing colour of the biomorph, evolving the 
biomorph using the branch selector, returning to the previous evolved biomorph and evolving the 
biomorph using the panels.

1. Generate 	
This is will generate artwork iteratively by the computer through an artificial evolutionary 
process. The software will have random representations of different artworks and the process will
be repeated if this button is pressed

2. Undo
returns the previous evolved biomorph

3. Change Colour
Change the colour of the biomorph using the sliders 

3.1 Update 
Updates the biomorph with the chosen colour.

4.Save/Load
Loads the save as JPEG, Load Project, Save as Project and Cancel button

4.1 Save as Image
Save the biomorph as a image by clicking this button. 

4.2 Load Project
Load an existing project by clicking here.

4.3 Save as Project
Save your project by clicking this button. 

4.4 Cancel
Returns the previous buttons,Save/Load,Help,Exit,Main Menu and Add to Hall of Fame

5. Current Biomorph Panel
Displays the evolved biomorph

5.1 Branch Selector
This will allow to evolve the biomorph by selecting the branch and changing the angles and size
using the mouse pad 

6. Evolutionary Panels
Evolves the current biomorph when they have been pressed on

7. Add to Hall of Fame 
Adds the current biomorph to the Hall of Fame

8.Hall of Fame panels
Display the saved biomorphs

8.1 Remove
